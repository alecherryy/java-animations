ShapeType Enum:
    1. Rectangle
    2. Square
    3. Oval
    4. Circle
    5. (optional) OTHER - we could use this type for those shapes that need speciic info in order to be created.
    If selected, the user coul specify the number of sides of the shape, opening the way to triangles, pentagons, exagons, etc.
    THIS IS NOT PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION YET.
Shape CLASS:
1. Common traits:
    - Name
    - Height
    - Width
    - Corner radius*
    - Color
    - Position
    - Keyframe
2. Can change:
    - Color
    - Position
    - Size/scale
*Note: we can use corner radius to determine whether a shape is a
square/rectangle, oval or circle. A circle has equal height, width and corner
radius equal to its height and width. An oval has different height and width, 
and corner radius equal to height/width.
